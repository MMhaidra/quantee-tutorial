    "Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks located in animal brains and are used to approximate functions that are unknown. The basic component of ANN is an artificial neuron and the way how the neurons are connected is called a network topology. There are various types of ANN including feedforward neural network, radial basis function network (RBF) or recurrent neural network (RNN) with the first being most commonly used in machine learning applications. The fully-connected feedforward neural network consists of several layers including an input layer, a number of hidden layers and one output layer. It is characterized by the fact that each neuron in a layer has only directed connections to all neurons of the next layer. To describe the fully-connected feedforward neural network we use standard notation. The $j$-th neuron in the $l$-th layer of a network takes a number of inputs, $a_k^{(l-1)}$, where $k=1,\\dots, n$ is an index of a neuron in the previous layer consisting of $n$ neurons. An input is then multiplied by a corresponding weight, $w_{jk}^{(l)}$ and an output $a_j^{(l)}$ is calculated by some nonlinear function $g(z_j^{(l)})$ of the weighted input\n",
    "$$z_j^{(l)}=\\sum_{k=1}^n w_{jk}^{(l)} a_k^{(l-1)}$$\n",
    "The function $g$ is known as _activation function_ and the most commonly used functions are Heaviside step function, sigmoid function and Rectified Linear Unit (RELU) function. The output functions in the last layer are restricted by the type of supervised machine learning algorithm. In classification problems, we are interested in outputs of range $[0,1]$, therefore sigmoid function can be used, whereas in regression problems the output function is set as $g(z_j^{(l)})=z_j^{(l)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To produce the desired output given an input, ANN are trained by a learning algorithm. The learning algorithm optimizes weights with an aim of minimizing a predefined cost function such as mean squared error (MSE) in regression problems. The weights of ANN can be optimized with gradient descent procedures using efficient backpropagation algorithm. Generally, in each iteration of the backpropagation algorithm a gradient descent procedure updates the weights in the direction of the greatest decrease of a cost function:\n",
    "$$\\delta w_{jk}^{(l)} = - \\eta \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial w_{jk}^{(l)}}$$\n",
